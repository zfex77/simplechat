# t1 - HTML displaying in SimpleChat
This isn't really a bug or a lacking feature as I want this to work, but it can be easily abusable, therefore I need to code in some restrictions. This might take a while. You might be asking: `how is it abusable?`

Well it's because you can type entire HTML scripts into the chat and it will display as such. Even if it will destroy the interface. I still want it to exist though because you can do cool things like, colored text, headers, scrolling text, images, and etc. For now, it's not that much of a biggie. Anyway that's what this clarifaction is for!
