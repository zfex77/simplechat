## How do I use the site?
**MESSAGING** - Well for messaging it's quite simple, Literally just type out the message and press the send button (or just the enter key.) 

**IMAGES** - For showing images, copy and paste the direct image link address (only works with GIFs, PNGs, and JPG/JPEGs.)

**ONLINE USERS** - To check which users are online (currently, it is pretty buggy.) click the icon at the top-right corner and it should open a page that shows the current online users.

**CREATING A PRIVATE CHANNEL** - When you press the button to create a channel, it will generate a private channel link (that it will automatically redirect you to). To share it with your friends, just copy the link from the bar.

> For now, that is all you need to know! Quite simple, amirite!
