***
A quite simple chat application that
uses the PubNub API.

- Managed and edited by [zfex77](https://github.com/zfex77) (me)

> ⚠️ I am not responsible for what users do, or say on this platform. **More importantly, I am using a free PubNub account, therefore if I reach a certain limit the application will stop working.**

## How do I use the site?
**MESSAGING** - Well for messaging it's quite simple, literally just type out the message and press the send button (or just the enter key.) 

**IMAGES** - For showing images, just paste the direct image link address (only works with GIFs, PNGs, and JPG/JPEGs.)

**ONLINE USERS** - To check which users are online (currently, it is quite buggy.) click the icon at the top-right corner and it should open a page that shows the current online users.

**CREATING A PRIVATE CHANNEL** - When you press the button to create a channel, it will generate a private channel link (that it will automatically redirect you to.) To share it to your friends, just copy the link from the bar.

> For now, that is all you need to know! Quite simple, amirite!
